    document.getElementById('words').innerText= 'The Greek War of Independence, which began in 1821, was a culmination of years of simmering discontent and a resurgence of Hellenic identity. The catalyst for the uprising was the call for autonomy and the rejection of Ottoman oppression, coupled with inspiration drawn from the Age of Enlightenment and other nationalist movements in Europe. The Greeks, led by charismatic figures such as Theodoros Kolokotronis and Alexandros Ypsilantis, engaged in a protracted struggle against the Ottoman Empire, enduring both triumphs and setbacks. International support played a pivotal role, with Philhellenes and foreign powers, particularly Britain, France, and Russia, providing aid to the Greek cause. The Greek War of Independence stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of national identity and the pursuit of freedom.'
